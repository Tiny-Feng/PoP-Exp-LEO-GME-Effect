# Proof-of-Principle-Experiment-of-Geomagnetic-Energy-Effect-for-LEO-Debris-Deorbiting
The current space debris population is rapidly growing, and over 70% of debris is distributed between the 500 km to 1000 km low earth orbit (LEO). No existing method or technique appears to be both technically feasible and economically viable for LEO debris removal.

A year ago we proposed the novel high-efficiency geomagnetic energy (GME) propellant approach to LEO (orbital altitude is less than 1000 km) space debris deorbiting, a new space momentum exchange approach from the angular kinetic energy to the linear kinetic energy; besides, we gave two kinds of spin angular momentum accumulation (SAMA) strategies to continuously store angular momentum for the spacecraft-debris system. To understand details of the GME approach and the SAMA, please refer to https://doi.org/10.1155/2019/5876861.

To verify the effect of LEO GME, the first ground-based proof-of-principle experimental systems is developed, and the systems modeling and control are treated. Then systems testing and calibration, and proof-of-principle experiments of GME effect are done.

Highlights

a) Geomagnetic energy propellant approach can achieve LEO debris rapid deorbiting.

b) First ground proof-of-principle experimental systems is developed.

c) LEO geomagnetic energy harvesting, exchange and storage are experimentally achieved.

d) LEO geomagnetic energy utilization in space is elementarily verified.

# Video 1: Geomagnetic Erergy (GME) Harvesting Experiment of the Coils
Under the condition of air floatation, the calibrated resistance torque by the manufacturer of the three-DOF air-bearing platform (ABP) is 10-4Nm, and the ABP can keep still an any angle. In the video, 

a) compared with the other torque in the systems, the resistance torque of the ABP can be ignored. Our experimenter can easily push the systems with the flick of a finger, and then reposition the systems at the angle of the maximum generated magnetic torque (GMT) (perpendicular to the geomagnetic north-south direction);

b) based on the torque effect of the geomagnetic field, the electrified coils can harvest the geomagnetic energy to rotate rapidly to the geomagnetic north-south direction.

# Video 2: Momentum Conservation Testing of the Systems
Under the condition of air floatation, the coils without the power supply rotate reversely when actively controlling the delivery subsystem. By this way, we can keep the coils still in the whole experimental process, when the electrified coils have a tendency of rotation under the geomagnetic field. It provides the feasibility of design for the following proof-of-principle experiments.
